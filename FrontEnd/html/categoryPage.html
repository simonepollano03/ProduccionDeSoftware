            <h3>Streetwear</h3>
            <p>
                Streetwear is a style of casual clothing which became global in the 1990s.
                It grew from New York hip hop fashion and Californian surf culture to encompass elements
                of sportswear, punk, skateboarding, 1980s nostalgia, and Japanese street fashion. Later, haute couture became an influence, and was in turn influenced by streetwear. Streetwear centers on comfortable clothing and accessories such as jeans, T-shirts, baseball caps, and sneakers.
